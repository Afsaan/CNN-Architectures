1. LeNet 5 

	LeNet-5, from the paper Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition, is a very efficient convolutional neural network for handwritten character recognition.

2. Alexnet
	
	AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the 	 	 runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of 	graphics processing units (GPUs) during training
